How to Use:
    <b>HOW TO COPY LOADS:<b><br>
     <br>1. Open TMW and go to Planned Worksheets.<br>
     2. From the drop down menu, Select *Refrigerated loads.<br>
     3. Sort loads by earliest PU Date either in descending or ascending order.<br>
     4. Left Click the first load for today to mark it.<br>
     5. While holding down left shift, left click the last load for today to select all loads for today.<br>
     6. Right click on any of the marked loads, go to Export to Excel, and choose *Export Selected<br>
     7. A Microsoft Excel instance will open with all the loads we selected in step 4 & step 5.<br>
     8. Using a left mouse click, mark ONLY the LoadID from top to bottom.<br>
     9. Press CTRL + V.<br><br><br>
    
    HOW TO USE TMW CHECKER:
     1. After TMW CHECKER starts, You will be required to post the loads you exported from TMW FIRST!<br>
     2. The Script runs in BASH so you have to use CTRL + SHIFT + V to paste your selection.<br>
     3.After you've pasted the loads, type START and press Enter.<br>
     4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 with the loads from the local MGL Spreadsheet.<br>
     5. After the program is done, check the summary.
    
IMPORTANT: THE ORDER THAT YOU INSERT THE LOADS IS ALWAYS TMW FIRST, MGL SPREADSHEET SECOND. OTHERWISE RESULTS WILL NOT BE ACCURATE!!<br><br>
