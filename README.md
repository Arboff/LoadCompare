How to Use:
    HOW TO COPY LOADS:
     1. Open TMW and go to Planned Worksheets.
     2. From the drop down menu, Select *Refrigerated loads.
     3. Sort loads by earliest PU Date either in descending or ascending order.
     4. Left Click the first load for today to mark it.
     5. While holding down left shift, left click the last load for today to select all loads for today.
     6. Right click on any of the marked loads, go to Export to Excel, and choose *Export Selected
     7. A Microsoft Excel instance will open with all the loads we selected in step 4 & step 5.
     8. Using a left mouse click, mark ONLY the LoadID from top to bottom.
     9. Press CTRL + V.
    
    
HOW TO USE TMW CHECKER:
     1. After TMW CHECKER starts, You will be required to post the loads you exported from TMW FIRST!
     2. The Script runs in BASH so you have to use CTRL + SHIFT + V to paste your selection.
     3.After you've pasted the loads, type START and press Enter.
     4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 with the loads from the local MGL Spreadsheet.
     5. After the program is done, check the summary.
    
IMPORTANT: THE ORDER THAT YOU INSERT THE LOADS IS ALWAYS TMW FIRST, MGL SPREADSHEET SECOND. OTHERWISE RESULTS WILL NOT BE ACCURATE!!
